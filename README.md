## Manual control example
Use the serial port to control the arm manually:
* axis 1: "s" & "w"
* axis 2: "d" & "e"
* axis 3: "f" & "r"
* axis 4: "g" & "t"
* axis 5: "h" & "y"
* axis 6: "j" & "u"
* Move back to home position: "<"

The arm will return to home position automatically after 30 seconds of no activity to avoid overheating the motors.
